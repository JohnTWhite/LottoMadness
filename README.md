# LottoMadness
Put in your winning lotto numbers and see how many years it would take to win! This project demonstrates in a single JFrame successful model view controller techniques in Java, uses a Thread to generate random number 1-50, and keeps track of any matches of 3 or more user supplied numbers vs thread generated numbers.
